Stanford ACM-ICPC
=================

This is a repository for the Stanford ACM-ICPC teams.
It currently hosts (a) the team notebook, and (b) complete lecture slides for [CS 97SI](http://stanford.edu/class/cs97si/).

The team notebook is compiled from codes written by previous Stanford team members and coaches. Currently, the steps for generating the HTML and PDF files are outdated and somewhat complicated. We hope to make this process a lot simpler and hopefully cross-platform.
