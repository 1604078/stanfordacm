* Write a faster FFT code.
* Add fast Hadamard transform for solving the following problem:
    Given A[], B[], find C[] such that
      C[i] = sum_j A[j] B[i xor j]
* Error-check the codes in stanford-cardinal-16 and merge them to the existing code base.
* Apostrophes in the title of a code file are translated as a accent in LaTeX; need to correct the behavior.
